    <a href="https://google.com" target = "_blank">Go to Google</a>
    Now, the problem arises here is that as soon as we click on the keyword, the website will open on the same webpage but if in case you want to open the website in a new tab then you have to add a new attribute in the anchor tag I.e. “target". 
    You might be confused between tag and attribute, then let me quickly tell you the difference between both. 
    Tag is like a container that allows you to handle an element whereas attribute is the property that enhances that container makes it more convenient to use. 
    To open a website in a new tab, you have to write something like this:
-->

<!--
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" alt= "Error loading image">
    Here “src" is the field where you have to insert the URL or address of the image and the “alt" attribute is a field that will display to users if their browser fails to load the image. 
    In the “alt" tag, we generally input a keyword of the image that can define the image in case the user can’t see the image.

<!--
    <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?nature,water" alt= "Error loading image">
    Here a random image will be loaded because this URL stores multiple images and any one of them gets reloaded every time we refresh the webpage. 
    Apart from this, let's see another example where we can adjust the height and width of the image using the URL only. Well, this is not something that we can do in every URL. Here we can do it because the developers of the website have created this URL accordingly.
