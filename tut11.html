    You will normally say that all the extra spaces will
    reflect back on the webpage. But it is not so. Because HTML treats all the extra spaces as a single space only and automatically removes all of them. Therefore, if you want to use extra spaces or any special characters, then you have to use HTML entities. To get extra space we can use &nbsp (non-breaking space) after that particular text. For example-
    <div class= “container”>
          <p>This is another &nbsp Paragraph</p>
    </div>
