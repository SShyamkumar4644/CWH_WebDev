Till now, we have only one file inside this directory i.e., tut69.js. But as 
soon as we write npm init on the terminal, it asks several questions like the 
package name, version, description, entry point, keyword, author, etc. When we 
execute this, there is a new file called package.json inside the tut69 directory.
NPM init has initialized this folder in terms of a node package. Now when we 
install any other dependency, it automatically gets added to this package. For 
example, if we write npm install slugify, the package.json file will automatically 
get updated. In the same way, we can install or uninstall any of the packages 
from the directory. Besides all these things, we also get another folder called 
node.modules. It is a folder containing all the modules related to our project. 
If by mistake this folder gets deleted, we can recover it back by again installing 
npm by writing npm install. If we want to install any specific version of the 
dependency, we can easily do that. For example, if want to install version 1.3.5 
of slugify, we have to write as npm install slugify@1.3.5. As soon as write this, 
the version gets updated.
